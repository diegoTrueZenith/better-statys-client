    "review": "The best Airbnb stay hands down. I rented this as a 4 day Thanksgiving retreat for me and my family after not seeing each other for a decade because of family drama. I thought this was the perfect choice because of all the fun family activities that would allow people to play and be together but at the same time, have choices and be spread out (key if your family is prone to family fighting). There was a massage chair room, a pool, sauna, jacuzzi, work out area, grill area, an arcade room with lots of game choices, and multiple TVs which was great for setting up the sports room, the Nintendo switch game room, and movie room for the kiddos. There was also so many beds and places for everyone to sleep. It was the best time and money spent. I hope to be back!!!"

    "review": "Great spot! Our kids had a blast with all the goodies in the garage. The golf bay and bubble hockey were favorites. There is an Infinity game table in the living room and the massage chairs in a separate room were a hit as well. Lots of thoughtful touches throughout the house. Hot tub is great and Philip was quick to respond. Highly recommended. Grocery and restaurant options nearby if you venture out. Great place for kids."
